A dark-haired, light-skinned baby of mixed Indigenous heritage wearing blue jeans and a white, long-sleeved t-shirt sits up on a white floor, in front of a plain white wall. The baby wears a VR headset woven from sweetgrass with sweetgrass braids securing it over the baby’s head. The baby tilts their head slightly down, as if focusing into the VR world, and rests one hand on the headset. With the other hand, they hold up a small, partly burnt sweetgrass braid. Scattered on the ground near the baby’s outstretched legs and bare feet are small bits of sweetgrass fibre, some slightly darkened.
