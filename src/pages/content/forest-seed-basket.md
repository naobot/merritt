<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Image description:</span> A life-sized oxygen tank on its wheeled cylinder cart, with the tank, regulator, tubing, and mask all composed of handwoven Black Ash splints. The cart handle is crafted from wooden dowels and Black Ash splints. The body of the oxygen tank is pale with reddish stripes circling it, made of darker splints. This basket holds seed cones for Sitka Spruce trees, Indigenous to the Pacific coast of North America. The tank is positioned on a pale floor near a stark white wall.
