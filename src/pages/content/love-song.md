<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Image description:</span> Against a simple white surface, a black and gold stethoscope. The ear tubes and ear tips are replaced by a palm fibre basket handwoven in the shape of life-sized over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. This basket can serve to translate heartbeats into love songs. Light glints off of small gold cuffs along the rubber tubing of the stethoscope, and the tubing is gently curved so that the gold drum is set next to the woven headphones.
