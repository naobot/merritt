A good love song marks a trajectory of desire, acknowledging the distance between what is and
what could be. They are sometimes celebratory; sometimes sad or angry. The possibility of
traversing the distances they mark requires an honest assessment of current conditions and it
requires belief in the as yet unseen. To live in the space of a love song is to build up a
community, however intimate or grand, around the possibility of feeling made flesh, of belief
made manifest, of justice come to fruition. It is often a complicated place to be, but Johnson has some ideas about how to fortify ourselves for this labour.

and future realities that are rooted in connections to land.

In the videos below, Johnson proposes that the work of social, political and personal change
can begin from where one already is, with what one already has.
