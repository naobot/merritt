<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Image description:</span> This adult-sized fancy shawl is made from an inexpensive waterproof tarp, azure and shimmering where light hits folds and crinkles in the plastic that coats the tightly-woven tarp fabric. The sides and bottom edge are adorned with matching blue fringe, and near the shoulders are shiny blue ribbons to recognize the importance of celebrating and protecting Indigenous women as instrumental protectors of land, water, culture, and future generations. The fancy shawl is displayed on a plain white background.
